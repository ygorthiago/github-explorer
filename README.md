âš  To use the GitHub social authentication feature, it's necessary to have an application on Firebase and integrate it with Github OAuth.  Then, just have to create a ".env" file in the project root and populate it based on ".env.example" file with your Firebase configuration data.  In case of doubts, you can contact me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ygorthiago/)!
